### 🧠 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patterns from a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases.

### 🚀 Features

- Predicts disease based on multiple symptom inputs
- Trained with popular ML algorithms: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM
- Modular structure for training, testing, and inference
- FastAPI-powered backend for real-time prediction API
- Integrated Streamlit-based UI for seamless user interaction (optional HTML/CSS version also included)

### 🎨 User Interface

- Streamlit UI: Clean and responsive symptom input form for live predictions
- Allows users to enter 3 to 7 symptoms and receive a list of most probable diseases with confidence scores

### 📊 Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- FastAPI for backend API
- Streamlit for UI
- Jupyter Notebooks for model development

### 📁 Dataset

- Based on publicly available medical datasets with symptoms as features and diseases as labels
