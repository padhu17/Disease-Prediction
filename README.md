### ðŸ§  Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patterns from a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases.

#### ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts disease based on multiple symptom inputs

. Trained with popular ML algorithms: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM

. Modular structure for training, testing, and inference

. FastAPI-powered backend for real-time prediction API

. Integrated Streamlit-based UI for seamless user interaction (optional HTML/CSS version also included)
